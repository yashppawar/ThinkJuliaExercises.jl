## Exercise 2-2
## Repeating my advice from the previous chapter, whenever you learn a new feature, you should try it out in interactive mode and make errors on purpose to see what goes wrong.

## 1. Weâ€™ve seen that n = 42 is legal. What about 42 = n?
println("Ans 1:")

## 2. How about x = y = 1?
println("Ans 2:")

## 3. In some languages every statement ends with a semi-colon, ;. What happens if you put a semi-colon at the end of a Julia statement?
println("Ans 3:")

## 4. What if you put a period at the end of a statement?
println("Ans 4:")

## In math notation you can multiply x and y like this: x y. What happens if you try that in Julia? What about 5x?
println("Ans 5:")

println("End.")
