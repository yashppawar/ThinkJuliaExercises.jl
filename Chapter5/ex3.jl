## Exercise 5-3
## Fermat’s Last Theorem says that there are no positive integers a, b, and c such that

## a^n+b^n=c^n
## for any value of n greater than 2.

## Write a function named checkfermat that takes four parameters—a, b, c and n—and checks to see if Fermat’s theorem holds. If n is greater than 2 and a^n + b^n == c^n the program should print, “Holy smokes, Fermat was wrong!” Otherwise the program should print, “No, that doesn’t work.”

## Write a function that prompts the user to input values for a, b, c and n, converts them to integers, and uses checkfermat to check whether they violate Fermat’s theorem.
println("Ans: ")

println("End.")
