## Write a function called circle that takes a turtle, t, and radius, r, as parameters and that draws an approximate circle by calling polygon with an appropriate length and number of sides. Test your function with a range of values of r.

## TIP
## Figure out the circumference of the circle and make sure that len * n == circumference.
println("Ans: ")
