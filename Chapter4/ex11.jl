## Exercise 4-11
## The letters of the alphabet can be constructed from a moderate number of basic elements, like vertical and horizontal lines and a few curves. Design an alphabet that can be drawn with a minimal number of basic elements and then write functions that draw the letters.

## You should write one function for each letter, with names draw_a, draw_b, etc., and put your functions in a file named letters.jl.
println("Ans: ")

println("End.")
